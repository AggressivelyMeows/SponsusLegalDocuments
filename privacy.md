# Sponsus Privacy Policy

Your privacy is worth the world to us. We will do everything within our power to make sure that you remain as private as possible.  

Our privacy policy is GDPR, & CCPA compliant.

### Subjects we will talk about:
* What data does Sponsus collect?
* How do we collect your data?
* How will we use your data?
* Your data and Marketing
* What are your data rights?
* What are cookies and how we use them
* Future changes to our policy

### Data we collect, how we collect it, and how we use your data.
When signing up, we collect this information about you:  
* Email address
* Internet protocol address (IP)

During the standard operation of Sponsus, we log requests to stop attacks and other malicious use. In these logs, your IP and what resource you are requesting are stored on internal records however the majority of these are deleted within 24 hours.

We also run our own internal analytics tool called Matomo. This tool collects the following information: ip, url, user agent, screen size, any plugins installed, and geographical location based on ip (country only). Data collected by this does not leave our servers. **We will never sell or give others access to this information.**

##### How?
You directly provide Sponsus with mode of the data we collect. We collect data and process when you:
* When you make a request to our servers (API). We need to process the data provided in order to return a response to you. For example, getting a users posts.

*Yes I know its obvious that's what we are using your data for, but we have to be specific or we can be sued*

##### How will we use this data?
Sponsus will use the collected data to provide you with the service you requested. We will also use the email address to send updates to your account. If you do not wish to receive these emails, you can turn them off in the dashboard.

##### What about storage?
We securely store your data in a database located in New York. Sponsus will keep this information stored indefinitely until you request us to delete it. This can be done via the delete button marked clearly next to the object or via an email request in the event of wanting to remove all traces of you from Sponsus's databases.

#### "Do not track" header support
Our inhouse tracking software does respect DNT headers so if you have that header set, it will not track what pages you look at.

### What are your data protection rights?
Since privacy is one of our core values at Sponsus, we want to make sure that you know your rights to your data that is stored by us:
* **Your right to access:** You have the right to request data that is related to you. This includes, but is not limited to, your profile, posts, and payments made on Sponsus.
* **Your right to rectification:** You have the right to request Sponsus to change any information that is incorrect or missing from our records. The majority of the time, you can do this via the website.
* **Your right to erasure** You have the right to request us to remove all personal information from our database and servers.

::: warning
Since Sponsus is a small project as of the time of writing this, we may be under pressure to respond in time. However, we are legally required to respond in 1 month.

### Cookies
Sponsus does not use cookies to operate the site. However, embeded sites may use cookies to track you. We cannot block these as they are outside of our security domain.

### Links to other sites
The Sponsus website contains links to other sites. Our privacy policy only applies to Sponsus. You should *really* read the other sites privacy policy if you want a true understanding on how your data is being used by others. I would highly recommend reading the privacy policy for services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.

### Changes to our policy
Sponsus keeps its privacy policy under regular review and places any updates on this page (https://sponsus.org/privacy) as well as on our GitHub so you can see when and what changes were made.

### How to contact Sponsus
If you have a privacy question, you can email the staff at \`privacy@sponsus.org\`. This includes everything from requests to remove data, questions about the policy, or if this page has not addressed your concern.
